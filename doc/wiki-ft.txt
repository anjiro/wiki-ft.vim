INTRODUCTION                                                    *wiki-ft-intro*

This is a simple filetype plugin for `.wiki` files that adds some syntax
highlighting and very simple folding functions. It depends on |wiki.vim|
(https://github.com/lervag/wiki.vim) for proper highlighting of links.

The folding function simply adds folds according to section depth.

Installation~

If you use |vim-plug| (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), then add the
following lines to your `vimrc` file: >

  Plug 'lervag/wiki.vim'
  Plug 'lervag/wiki-ft.vim'

  " If you do not want to use the wiki.vim plugin:
  let g:wiki_loaded = 1

SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING                                            *wiki-ft-syntax*

This plugin supports a relatively standard type of simple Markdown syntax.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMON ELEMENTS                                         *wiki-ft-syntax-common*

The following listing shows the set of common syntax elements that are
currently supported: >

  # Level 1 headings

  ## Level 2 headings

  Text formatting and math:
  - *bold text*
  - _italic text_
  - `inline code`
  - $f(x) = 1$

  Tables:
  |-----+-----------|
  | ID  | Value     |
  |-----+-----------|
  | 1   | Entry 1   |
  | 2   | Entry 2   |
  | ... | Entry ... |
  | 12  | Entry 12  |

  the continued lines do not start with the initial quote symbol.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINKS                                                    *wiki-ft-syntax-links*

A link typically consists of an url and a description, although the
description may be ignored.  The links will be highlighted and the |+conceal|
feature is used to only display the descriptions if they are present.

The following listing shows some examples of links. >

  [[Link]]
  [[Link|With description]]

  [Description](Link)

  Inline numbered links like this is also supported [0]. The link is supplied
  below.

  [0]: Link
<
URLs are also highlighted directly, e.g.: >

  journal:2013-04-05
  http://www.google.com
  doi:10.1002%2Fandp.19053220607
  file:/path/to/file

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODE BLOCKS                                               *wiki-ft-syntax-code*

Code blocks are blocks like the following: >

  ```sh
  ls ~
  echo "hello world"
  ```

If the code block has a language specifier, then the block will be highlighted
accordingly.

Note: The file is parsed when opened for code blocks, and only the languages
      detected are highlighted. Thus, if one adds a new code block with a new
      language, one may need to reload the file to get the appropriate
      highlighting.
